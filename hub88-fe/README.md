# This project was created to test developer's abilities

#### DISCLAIMER: When I first started this project, I created a form and query to request data by code using submit button. 
There are two views side to side. One on the left is with a submit button and on the right is without (triggers after input)
 
## Getting started

If you're running the project for the first time:

### `npm install && npm start`

After packages have been installed, it is enough to run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## In order to run the test:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
If you re-save the files, test will auto-run. No need to run them manually again.
